State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)

Database Schema- A schema defines the logical structure of the database. It describes how data is organized and how relationships between data elements are structured.
Data Integrity Management- data integrity ensures the accuracy and consistency of the data stored in the database.
Backup and Recovery - The backup and recovery component ensures that the database can be restored to a consistent state in case of hardware failure, or data loss.
Security and access Control - Explanation: The security component of a DBMS ensures that only authorized users can access or manipulate the database
Storage Management - This component is responsible for the efficient storage and retrieval of data.
